# Embedded_C_reference_codes

This repository contains various reference codes for beginners who wish to learn about interfacing modules like LCD, LED, Seven Segment, Motor, ADc, DAC, RTC, eeprom, port expander, RTC, Keypad  with 8051 microcontroller.

Fundamental knowledge on controller 8051 is required. 
Basic knowledge of display devices, active and passive components, drivers is necessary.

These are just the codes in Embedded c that could be built into 8051 controller of 8051 development board. The perepherals need to be connected to the correct ports of controller along with appropriate clock and power supply in order for everything to function correctly.

For more information on interfacing with 8051 controller "The 8051 Microcontroller and Embedded Systems by Muhammad Ali Mazidi  (Author), Janice G. Mazidi (Author), Rolin D. McKinlay (Author)" book would be a good reference.

The codes in this repository have been used as reference in the projects stated in repositories car_parking_project and multivaiable_rs485.
